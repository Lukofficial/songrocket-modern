Understanding SoundCloud's payment structure helps set realistic expectations for earnings.

## Payment Rates

SoundCloud's fan-powered royalties mean earnings vary based on:

- Whether listeners are on free or premium tiers
- Geographic location of listeners
- How engaged your specific fans are

## Estimated Earnings

For 1,000 plays, artists typically earn between $2.50 and $4.00, though this can vary significantly.

## Maximizing Revenue

Focus on building engaged fans rather than chasing empty plays. Engaged listeners mean more revenue per stream.
