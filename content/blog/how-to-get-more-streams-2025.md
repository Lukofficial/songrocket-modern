Growing your Spotify streams requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are proven strategies for 2025.

## 1. Release Consistently

Aim for a new release every 4-6 weeks to stay in Release Radar and maintain momentum.

Reply to comments, go live, share behind-the-scenes content. Connection drives loyalty.
