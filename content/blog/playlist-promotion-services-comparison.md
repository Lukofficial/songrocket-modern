Choosing the right playlist promotion service can make or break your music campaign. Here's an honest comparison of the top platforms.

## SongRocket

- Manual curator vetting process
- Pay per review, not per stream
- Transparent pricing from $3
- Campaign extensions available
- Real curator feedback on every submission

## PlaylistPush

- Similar model to SongRocket
- Generally higher prices
- Less flexible budget options

## SubmitHub

- Credits-based system
- More focused on blogs and press
- Can be expensive per submission

## Groover

- European-focused platform
- Similar curator model
- Different pricing structure

**Key Takeaway:** All legitimate services share one thing—they don't guarantee placements or streams. Any service promising guaranteed results is likely using bots.
