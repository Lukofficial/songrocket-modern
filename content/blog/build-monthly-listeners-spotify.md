Growing monthly listeners requires consistent effort. Here are proven strategies.

## Release Consistently

New music keeps you in Release Radar and maintains listener engagement.

## Playlist Pitching

Use SongRocket to reach curators. Third-party playlists are the #1 driver of discovery.

## Social Media Promotion

Every platform should drive listeners to Spotify. Use link-in-bio tools.

## Engage Your Audience

Listeners become monthly listeners when they connect with you as an artist.
