Planning to release a cover song? Here's what you need to know about licensing.

## What License Do You Need?

For streaming platforms, you need a **mechanical license**. Most distributors handle this automatically through services like:

- DistroKid (built-in licensing)
- Easy Song Licensing
- Songfile by HFA

## For YouTube

YouTube has agreements with publishers, but you may still face Content ID claims. Consider a sync license for full protection.
