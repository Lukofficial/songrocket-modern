In 2025, with streaming platforms and social media dominating music discovery, do artists still need their own website?

## The Short Answer: Yes

While social media is essential, having your own website gives you:

- **Ownership:** You control the content, design, and data
- **Professionalism:** Industry contacts expect artists to have websites
- **Email Collection:** Build a direct connection with fans
- **Merch & Music Sales:** Sell directly without platform fees
- **EPK (Electronic Press Kit):** Essential for booking and press

## What Your Website Should Include

- Bio and photos
- Music player with streaming links
- Tour dates
- Contact information
- Press kit
- Email signup form
