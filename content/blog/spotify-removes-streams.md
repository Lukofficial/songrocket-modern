Spotify actively monitors for artificial streaming and removes fake plays. Understanding why this happens is crucial for protecting your artist account.

## Why Spotify Removes Streams

- You used a bot service to inflate streams
- Your track was on a playlist with bot listeners
- You bought streams from a third party
- Unusual listening patterns detected

## Consequences

- Streams removed from your count
- Royalties clawed back
- Potential removal from algorithmic playlists
- Account flagged or terminated

## How to Protect Yourself

- Only use legitimate promotion services like SongRocket
- Avoid any service that guarantees streams
- Monitor your Spotify for Artists for unusual activity
- Report suspicious activity immediately
