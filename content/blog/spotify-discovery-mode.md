Spotify Discovery Mode lets artists boost their music in exchange for lower royalty rates. Here's what you need to know.

## How It Works

You select tracks to prioritize in Discovery Mode. Spotify shows them more frequently in algorithmic playlists like Radio and Autoplay.

## The Trade-off

In exchange for increased exposure, you agree to a promotional royalty rate on streams from these placements.

## Is It Worth It?

For new releases or catalog tracks that need a boost, it can be effective. Test it on a few tracks before committing more.
