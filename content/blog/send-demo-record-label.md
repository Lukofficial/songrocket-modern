Submitting demos to record labels requires strategy and professionalism. Here's the right approach.

## Research First

Only submit to labels that sign artists in your genre. Check their roster and recent releases.

## What to Include

- 2-3 of your best tracks
- Brief bio (2-3 paragraphs)
- Links to streaming profiles
- Social media statistics
- Press photos

## How to Submit

Check the label's website for submission guidelines. Many use email or online forms. Never send unsolicited attachments.
