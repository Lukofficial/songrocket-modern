How do you know if a playlist service is legitimate? Here are the green flags and red flags to watch for.

## Green Flags

- Transparent about not guaranteeing placements
- Manual curator vetting process
- Payment for reviews, not streams
- Real company information and support
- Positive reviews from verified users
- Compliant with Spotify's terms

## Red Flags

- Guarantees streams or placements
- Unusually cheap prices
- No curator vetting
- Promises editorial playlist placement
- No refund or support policy
- Anonymous or offshore company
